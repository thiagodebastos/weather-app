# Show the Local Weather
Example: [http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV](http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV)

- [ ] Rule 1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

- [ ] Rule 2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

- [ ] **User Story**: I can see the weather in my current location.

- [ ] **User Story**: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

- [ ] **User Story**: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

- [ ] We recommend using the Open Weather API. This will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.

- [ ] Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

- [ ] When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

- [ ] You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
